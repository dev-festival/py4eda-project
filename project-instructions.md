# Explore a "real world" dataset:

* Real-world data, source must be attributed
* Prefer data relevant to your work / research, but nothing sensitive or shouldn't be shared
* Data found online is ok, but your analysis must be your own work and will be scrutinized
    * don't choose something where you have no personal understanding
* Must be non-trivial (prefer 5,000+ observations, 10+ features) but avoid sets with 20+ features
    * smaller datasets require instructor approval (I will be reasonable - tell me why you are interested)

## Then apply the EDA workflow outlined in lecture 13a:

1) Load & Initial Reconnaissance
2) Data Quality Assessment
3) Cleaning Decisions
4) Statistical EDA
5) Transformation
6) Save & Document

 Remember that this should be question-driven (from the start, i.e., step 0 is identify some questions you want to answer), iterative, and non-linear.

The bulk of your work should be in notebook(s). It should:

Demonstrate an overall understanding of the data
Identify and correct problems with the data - types, missing / bad, outliers, etc.
Find informative patterns and relationships in the data
Engineer features that lead to additional insights
Generate and explore hypotheses related to the data (no formal statistical testing required)
Employ the right mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis
Effectively leverage the notebook format, mixing text, code, and results in a coherent manner
Apply principles and best practices covered in the class
Essentially, apply what you've learned in this class, end-to-end, on real data.

Additionally, for graduate students, you will use streamlit to create an interactive dashboard to explore your data. The design of this will vary based on what you are trying to explore (u / b / m).

Project Deliverables:

The url for a github repo with your group's work, included with this submission
create a separate repo under one or both student github accounts for this work
it must include the data, notebooks, and py file for the streamlit app
it should also include a suitable readme file and use an appropriate organizational strategy
(Grad-only) A pre-recorded video presenting it, uploaded with this submission
minimum 5 minutes, maximum 10; semi-formal
not a line by line walkthrough, just talk us through the high points
Feedback on other team presentations, a separate assignment
Your submission will be graded based on:

Science (20pts): questions and findings
Engineering (20pts): process, validation / verification
Skills (38pts): implementation
Professionalism (10pts): overall quality of the work submitted
Ambition (5pts, bonus): extra points available to teams that exceed expectations, esp as it relates to the dashboard
You are allowed to leverage AI tools in support of this work, but you must be able to explain the implementation and justify the decisions made in your analysis.
